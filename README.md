# About me

- Into software engineering
- I’m hella interested in psychology, especially in the field of mental health around cognitive distortions,  anxiety, mood, and personality disorders, and the treatment of mental disorders. I enjoy gaming and photography, and I'm all for the little things in life!

- Stay **kind** and **compassionate**. You never know what someone's life was like.
