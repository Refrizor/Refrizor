## Inferris
Inferris is an upcoming mature, age-gated (17+) community built on real conversation, connection, and shared experiences — hosted on Discord with an upcoming Minecraft network. Deep discussions, good vibes, no toxicity, and inclusive energy.

On the backend, I’m building a custom platform: RESTful API (Express), polyglot persistence (MySQL, MongoDB, Redis), chat moderation powered by Google Perspective API, a custom punishment system, and a full-featured staff panel (Argus) with account management, security features, and more.

The heart is community. The tech just helps make it thrive.
