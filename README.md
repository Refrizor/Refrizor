# About me

- Into software engineering
- I’m really into clinical psychology, especially around anxiety, mood, and personality disorders and the treatment of them primarily through types of psychotherapy (DBT, CBT, etc). I enjoy gaming and photography, and I'm all for the little things in life!

- Stay **kind** and **compassionate**! You never know what someone's life was like.
